## Nucleotide Count

Given a single stranded DNA string, compute how many times each nucleotide occurs in the string.

The genetic language of every living thing on the planet is DNA. DNA is a large molecule that is built from an extremely long sequence of individual elements called nucleotides. 
4 types exist in DNA and these differ only slightly and can be represented as the following symbols: 

```
'A' for adenine, 
'C' for cytosine, 
'G' for guanine, and 
'T' thymine.
```
